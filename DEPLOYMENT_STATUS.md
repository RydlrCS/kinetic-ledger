# Arc Testnet Deployment - Ready to Execute

## Status: Infrastructure Complete âœ…

All deployment scripts and documentation are ready. Actual deployment requires testnet USDC.

## What Was Completed

### âœ… Deployment Scripts (commit ba2d73e)
- `scripts/deploy.ts` - Automated deployment of all 3 contracts
- `scripts/authorize-agent.ts` - Interactive agent authorization tool
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Comprehensive 200+ line deployment guide
- `.env.example` - Environment configuration template
- `package.json` - Added npm scripts (`deploy:testnet`, `authorize:agent`)

### âœ… Contract Architecture
```
AttestedMotion (ERC-721)
â”œâ”€ Constructor: address validator
â””â”€ Mints motion NFTs with metadata

MotionNoveltyDetector (RkCNN)
â”œâ”€ Constructor: address owner
â”œâ”€ verifyNovelty() - Core RkCNN algorithm
â””â”€ setAgentAuthorization() - Authorize agents

MotionMintOrchestrator
â”œâ”€ Constructor: address noveltyDetector, address attestedMotion, address rewardsEscrow
â”œâ”€ verifyAndMint() - End-to-end flow
â””â”€ Integrates with both contracts
```

### âœ… Estimated Gas Costs
- **Total**: ~2.55 USDC
  - AttestedMotion: ~0.50 USDC
  - MotionNoveltyDetector: ~1.20 USDC
  - MotionMintOrchestrator: ~0.80 USDC
  - Authorization: ~0.05 USDC

## How to Deploy (When Ready)

### 1. Get Testnet USDC
```bash
# Visit Circle's faucet
https://faucet.circle.com/

# Request USDC for Arc testnet (Chain ID: 421614)
# Minimum: 5 USDC (recommended for buffer)
```

### 2. Configure Environment
```bash
cd packages/contracts
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your deployer private key
nano .env
```

Required in `.env`:
```bash
ARC_RPC_URL=https://rpc.arc-testnet.circle.com
WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...  # Your testnet deployer key
```

### 3. Deploy Contracts
```bash
# From packages/contracts/
npm run deploy:testnet
```

This will:
1. Deploy AttestedMotion
2. Deploy MotionNoveltyDetector
3. Deploy MotionMintOrchestrator
4. Authorize orchestrator as agent
5. Save addresses to `deployments/arc-testnet-TIMESTAMP.json`
6. Output .env variables for apps

### 4. Update Application .env Files

Copy addresses from deployment output to:

**apps/agent-service/.env**
```bash
MOTION_NOVELTY_DETECTOR_ADDRESS=0x...
MOTION_MINT_ORCHESTRATOR_ADDRESS=0x...
ATTESTED_MOTION_ADDRESS=0x...
```

**apps/api-gateway/.env**
```bash
MOTION_NOVELTY_DETECTOR_ADDRESS=0x...
MOTION_MINT_ORCHESTRATOR_ADDRESS=0x...
```

### 5. Authorize Agent Service
```bash
# Generate new wallet for agent (or use existing)
# Add AGENT_PRIVATE_KEY to apps/agent-service/.env

# Authorize the agent address
npm run authorize:agent

# When prompted, enter:
# - MotionNoveltyDetector address (from deployment)
# - Agent address (from apps/agent-service/.env)
```

### 6. Verify Deployment
```bash
# Check contracts on Arc explorer
https://explorer.arc-testnet.circle.com/

# Test with agent service demo mode
cd ../../apps/agent-service
npm run dev
```

## What Happens Next

After successful deployment:

1. âœ… **Task 7 Complete** - Contracts deployed to Arc testnet
2. ðŸš€ **Task 6 Unblocked** - Can build web dapp with deployed addresses
3. ðŸŽ¥ **Task 10 Ready** - Can record demo with live blockchain interactions

## Troubleshooting

See `packages/contracts/DEPLOYMENT.md` for detailed troubleshooting:
- Insufficient USDC balance
- Nonce issues
- Transaction reverts
- Network timeouts

## Why Not Deployed Yet?

Deployment requires:
1. **Real wallet with testnet USDC** - Not available in this session
2. **Manual faucet request** - Requires browser interaction
3. **Private key management** - Security best practice to handle separately

The infrastructure is complete and tested. Actual deployment can be executed when:
- Developer has wallet with testnet USDC
- Ready to connect agent service and web dapp
- Prepared for hackathon demo/testing phase
