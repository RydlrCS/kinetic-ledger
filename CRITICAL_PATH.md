## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### What If Vercel Deployment Fails?
**Backup Plan**: Deploy to Netlify or GitHub Pages
```bash
# Netlify CLI
npm i -g netlify-cli
netlify login
netlify deploy --prod
```

### What If Video Recording Takes Longer?
**Backup Plan**: Submit without video initially, add later
- Devpost allows updating submission before deadline
- Video enhances submission but isn't strictly required
- Focus on live demo + screenshots first

### What If Cover Image Design Stalls?
**Backup Plan**: Use simple text-based design
- Use Canva template (faster than custom design)
- Or screenshot from landing page + add text overlay
- Quality matters less than having something

### What If Hit Unexpected Bug?
**Backup Plan**: Document and workaround
- Add "Known Issues" section to README
- Note limitations in Devpost submission
- Judges value transparency over perfection
