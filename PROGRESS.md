## üîÑ In Progress

### Node.js Environment Upgrade
**Status**: Running `brew install node@20` (download phase)  
**Blocker**: Current Node v17.8.0 incompatible with Hardhat 2.22.10  
**Expected Resolution**: 10-15 minutes for Homebrew installation  
**Next Steps**:
1. Configure PATH: `export PATH="/usr/local/opt/node@20/bin:$PATH"`
2. Verify: `node --version` (expect v20.19.5)
3. Reinstall dependencies: `cd packages/contracts && npm install`
4. Compile contracts: `npx hardhat compile`
5. Run tests: `npx hardhat test`

## ‚ùå Not Started (Critical Path)

### Immediate Next Steps (After Node Upgrade)
1. **Compile & Test Contracts** - Verify AttestedMotion and RewardsEscrow build and pass tests
2. **Shared Schema Package** - Create TypeScript types for EIP-712, motion data structures, API contracts
3. **API Gateway** - FastAPI service with HMAC auth, CORS, rate limiting, verbose logging
4. **Agent Service** - TypeScript service with ethers.js, EIP-712 signing, streaming data processor
5. **Web Dapp** - Next.js 15 frontend with wagmi/viem, wallet integration, attestation UI

### Pre-Submission Requirements
6. **Arc Testnet Deployment** - Get USDC from faucet, deploy contracts, verify on explorer
7. **Data Pipeline Examples** - Fivetran configuration, sample motion data, streaming processor
8. **CI/CD Workflows** - GitHub Actions for testing, linting, deployment
9. **Creative Use Case Tests** - Multi-source pipeline tests, edge cases, scale testing (1000+ events)
10. **Presentation Materials** - Demo video, pitch deck, cover image, compelling README

## üìä Hackathon Judging Alignment

### Application of Technology (40%) - IN PROGRESS
- ‚úÖ Arc testnet configuration complete (hardhat.config.ts)
- ‚úÖ USDC-native contract design (RewardsEscrow)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Contracts not yet compiled/deployed
- ‚ùå No live demo yet
- ‚ùå AI agent integration not implemented

### Business Value (25%) - PLANNED
- ‚úÖ Clear use case: motion-triggered payments
- ‚úÖ Arc value proposition documented (README)
- ‚ùå No working prototype to demonstrate impact
- ‚ùå Adoption pathway not yet articulated

### Originality (20%) - STRONG FOUNDATION
- ‚úÖ Unique EIP-712 attestation pattern for off-chain motion data
- ‚úÖ Stream-based data processing for scalability
- ‚úÖ Privacy-first design (hashes on-chain, raw data off-chain)
- ‚ùå Need creative multi-source pipeline demo

### Presentation (15%) - NOT STARTED
- ‚ùå No demo video
- ‚ùå No pitch deck
- ‚ùå No cover image
- ‚ö†Ô∏è README exists but needs more Arc narrative

## üö® Risk Assessment

### High Priority Blockers
1. **Node.js Upgrade** (ACTIVE) - Blocks all contract work until resolved
2. **Time Constraint** - 9 days to build 6 major components + presentation
3. **Arc Testnet Familiarity** - First deployment, may encounter unexpected issues

### Medium Priority Concerns
- No AI/LLM integration yet (ElevenLabs voice, Cloudflare Workers AI)
- Cross-chain USDC movement (CCTP) not explored
- Account abstraction (Circle Wallets, Dynamic) not implemented

### Mitigation Strategy
- **Focus on MVP**: Prioritize working end-to-end demo over feature breadth
- **Parallel Development**: After Node upgrade, work on contracts + API + dapp simultaneously
- **Time-boxing**: Allocate max 1 day per major component (6 components = 6 days)
- **Reserve 2 days**: Final integration, testing, presentation materials
- **Cut scope if needed**: Voice AI and cross-chain features are nice-to-haves

## üìÖ Suggested Timeline

**Days 1-2** (Oct 31 - Nov 1):
- Complete Node upgrade
- Compile/test contracts ‚úÖ
- Deploy to Arc testnet ‚úÖ
- Build shared schema package ‚úÖ

**Days 3-4** (Nov 2 - Nov 3):
- Implement API gateway ‚úÖ
- Implement agent service ‚úÖ
- Create sample data pipeline ‚úÖ

**Days 5-6** (Nov 4 - Nov 5):
- Build web dapp frontend ‚úÖ
- End-to-end integration testing ‚úÖ
- CI/CD automation ‚úÖ

**Days 7-8** (Nov 6 - Nov 7):
- Creative use case tests ‚úÖ
- Demo video recording ‚úÖ
- Pitch deck creation ‚úÖ
- Polish README with Arc narrative ‚úÖ

**Day 9** (Nov 8):
- Final QA and bug fixes
- Submit before 2:30 AM EAT deadline
- Prepare for NYC pitching (if invited)

## üí° Key Insights

### What's Working Well
- **Comprehensive planning**: Copilot instructions and architecture documented upfront
- **Quality over speed**: Proper contract patterns (EIP-712, custom errors, events)
- **Test-driven**: Tests written alongside contracts, ready to run
- **Arc-native thinking**: USDC gas token central to design

### What Needs Attention
- **Execution velocity**: Need to move faster once Node upgrade completes
- **Integration risk**: Multiple new services need to work together seamlessly
- **Presentation prep**: Often underestimated; reserve sufficient time
- **Live demo dependency**: Everything hinges on Arc testnet deployment working

## üéØ Next Actions (Immediate)

1. **Monitor Node@20 Installation** - Check `brew install` completion
2. **Configure Environment** - Update PATH and verify Node version
3. **Reinstall Dependencies** - Clear old node_modules, fresh install with Node 20
4. **Compile Contracts** - First successful compilation will unblock everything
5. **Run Tests** - Verify AttestedMotion works as designed
6. **Update TODO List** - Mark Node upgrade complete, move to contract compilation
